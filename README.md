# IPTRACKER

https://ip-tracker-lquines.vercel.app/

This was a challenge from the frontend mentor site. It was coded based on
the jpg screenshot and the functionality specs.

The app willl identify the location of an IP or URL address on the map.

It uses the ip-api to grab the IP's location information. The IP address,
location, timezone and ISP name is shown. The OpenStreetMap API is then
used to grab and pinpoint the latitude and longitude on the OSM map.
